# A Tester's Rhyme

I click and I break things, it's what I do best,
Finding the bugs that escape all the rest.
"It works on my machine!" the devs always say,
But I'll find the edge case and ruin their day.

With patience and coffee, I poke and I prod,
Turning "it's finished" to "that's rather odd."
A tester's life is a glorious quest—
Breaking your code so the users get the best!
